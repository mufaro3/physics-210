\begin{document}
This is a three-body system. There is a black hole (which is fixed in space), very far away (so collisions with the black hole will only occur if all other bodies are moving at a very low speed), but a ship realizes that they are on course to be sucked into the black hole. There is a
 planet of slime that they can meet at some point in their journey (not entirely on their path but requiring a turn) which they can collide with with elastically, and cause the planet to stop and take all of its energy (so completely elastic). However, if there is too much energy transferred, the ship will break. What speed does it need to travel to make this collision successful?

Gravity Equation

$F = G\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$
