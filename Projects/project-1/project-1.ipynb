    "**Research Question:** Given a three-body system containing a black hole (with a mass $M$), a small planet made of JELL-O-like slime (with mass $m_p$), and a spaceship (with mass $m_s$) accidentally headed directly for the black hole, the only way for the spaceship to avoid being sucked into the black hole is to turn into and collide (inelastically) with the planet such that it is successfully rebounded with a velocity high enough to escape the gravitational pull of the black hole. However, if it hits the planet with too much impulse during the collision, it'll be destroyed by the planet (it's made out of JELL-O, so it has surface tension). \n",
