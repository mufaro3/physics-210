    "> Normally I would classify this as “Not a Priority”, but because you use LaTeX heavily (not a bad thing at all), the lack of LaTeX rendering severely impedes readability. Before you resubmit, go through and make sure that lines like render as LaTeX equations and not text. As you can see, this line renders as LaTeX here, but not in your project. You might just have to run the Markdown cells before downloading the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "I actually believe that this is a problem between Jupyter versions, as downloading the originally uploaded HTML on my machine renders all of the LaTeX completely fine. I'll attach a PDF version of my project alongside the HTML to try and rectify this, but this is likely an issue with using a local version of Jupyter. I'm using [the Debian 13 Trixie build of Jupyter 5.7.2-5](https://packages.debian.org/trixie/jupyter). It would help a lot if I could be provided with more information about the browser used to open it or any other information I can use to reproduce this problem, but without that, I hope that just attaching a PDF of the document should be good.\n",

    "Include a plot (probably near the beginning, but as long as it flows well with the narrative, the choice is yours) that shows the orbits of all electrons in a multi-electron system, instead of just one of the electrons. This will help your reader form a better mental image of the system, and how its components interact.\n",
