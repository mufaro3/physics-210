    "> This is a very interesting and creative concept. You've done a great job applying new physics concepts. The explanation of your model and assumptions is thorough and very well done, with good use of referneces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Unfortunately, none of your equations are rendering properly, which makes it difficult to read your report. This is really important for understandability and needs to be fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "I actually don't believe that this is a problem with my project, and rather, it's likely more of a computer-to-computer problem. The equations render perfectly fine on all of the computers that I've tried. Otherwise, as I can't reproduce this problem, I'm not quite sure how to fix it. I'll include a rendered PDF of my entire project alongside this submission to try and circumvent that (just in case), as Jupyter HTML export is a live-rendering of all of the equations (so these can break from browser-to-browser).\n",
    "\n",
    "> You clearly know what you're doing. Very impressive and adept use of classes, which we haven't even learned about in this course. Excellent code block summaries and descriptive variable names. Your code is very neat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you very much.\n",
    "\n",
    "> You have a good, clearly stated research question. There are several multi-panel plots (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 6) that give insight into the behaviour of the simulation. Your figure 5 does a great job at providing the main answer to your research question. The captions on all figures are excellent. Your discussion of results, next steps, and limitations are well-done and thorough. The quality of writing in this report is excellent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you very, very much.\n",
    "\n",
    "> I only have a few small issues with the communication in this project:\n",
    "> 1. You should remind the reader of your research question at the start of your conclusion before discussing the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've added the following section to the beginning of my conclusion: \"Once again, the goal of this project has been to locate the safest configuration of initial speed and turning angle for the spaceship to maximize its chances of successful escape from the black hole..\" I hope that it's sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 2. Does 0 utility mean that the ship is destroyed? I think you mentioned this in the introduction, but it's easy to forget. If this is true, you should mention it in the Fig. 5 caption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolutely, yes. I mistakenly used the wrong plotting function `plt.contour` rather than `plt.contourf`, so it doesn't really convey this well! I've fixed this and mentioned it in the figure 5 caption.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 3. You should put all the animations in the Appendix A. These animations definitely count as validation steps, but they aren't otherwise directly important to your investigation and should be left out of the main report body.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've added a section to the appendix, **A-2 Animations**, for exactly this purpose. I moved all of the animations located in the main body into this section, and they are now no-longer labelled \"debug-only\".\n",
    "\n",
    "> How did you choose the relative importance of each of the optimized variables? I can't find a discussion of this anywhere in the text. This is fairly important to the interpretation of your results and so you should discuss your choices, giving some justification for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've added a discussion of this to the end of the \"Optimization\" section, and it looks as this:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Determining the Weights\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the weights $w_1, w_2, w_3$, I started by understanding that I wanted the radial distance to be, by far, the most important variable in the system, followed by the speed and then the fuel. As well, mathematically, each of the weights should be normalized so that $w_1 + w_2 + w_3 = 1$ for simplicity, and I want the bias for distance, $w_2$, to be much more important than the bias for speed $w_3$ and the bias for fuel $w_1$, so $w_2 - w_3 > w_3 - w_1$. Most importantly, I want these variables to be more or less comparable regardless, so the ratio between each of the weights shouldn't be very high or very low such that one weight is dominating compared to another, and I believe that this works because I'm considering the realistic scenario of people on a space ship: they likely have a set mission to achieve, so running out of fuel would likely be the worst for them in the long term, but in the short term, merely escaping is the most important. From there, the best way to determine whether or not they've escaped is how far they are, and the best way to determine whether or not they will escape (if they haven't already) is how fast they are going. I don't make a consideration of whether the final velocity is oriented correctly (i.e., away from the black hole) as this can be reasonably assumed based on the parameters of the system (i.e., the ship is extremely unlikely to end up oriented in the direction of the black hole due to the restrictions of possible turning angles being explored in the simulation and the magnitude of initival velocities being performed being high enough that the gravitational acceleration from the black hole cannot reverse the motion of the ship during the simulation, so while it is possible that the ship could reverse, it is unlikely to occur during the time range of the simulation). \n",
    "\n",
    "> The validation step you have in Appendix A right now is good, but we are looking for at least 2 validation steps, one of which needs to be comparing by-hand calculations with your simulation results. I know that it's pretty impossible to do by-hand calculations with the 3-body problem, so you could remove 1 of the bodies just for this validation step. As discussed in the previous rubric items, your animations would also count as a third validation step.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've since added this section, and due to the obviously difficult nature in trying to have a validation like this for my simulation, I've focused largely on verifying simple scalar values at endpoints (like the beginning and end). It's a bit too long to include on this document, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Errata\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd also like to state the following changes made to the project during my review. First, I altered a few of the figure captions to add a bit more information, such as altering Figure 7's caption to\n",
    "\n",
    "> Figure 7. Furthermore, the energy and momentum of the system also just increase with time due to the distance and velocity increasing (but stabilize quite quickly due to the ship going very far very fast).\n",
    "\n",
    "and fixing the missing caption under Figure 8:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Figure 8. The impulse in the situation best illustrates why this is the optimal situation: the total normal force impulse comes the closest out of all of the simulations to reaching the minimum destructive impulse, so in other words, it is at the highest energy combination that can successfully perform a collision at this angle. A slight change to the angle or a higher velocity for this angle would likely result in a collision."
