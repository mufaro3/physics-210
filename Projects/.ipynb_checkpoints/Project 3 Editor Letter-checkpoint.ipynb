    "I spoke to Joss about this. I understand your concern, but I'm completely unsure what you mean by the \"array-based ... method we've laid out for you,\" as I never followed any sort of tutorial or outline for performing this project.  The starter code for this project (such as Homework 17) doesn't include a full process for this and Homework 16 isn't immediately applicable for these kinds of trees, so I'm not sure what you want me to compare against (as I've been using tree generation from the beginning of Homework 17). With that, Joss simply told me to ignore this.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, despite that, I would still like to provide some justification for my method to qualitatively defend it regardless. I actually made a major mistake in my prior assumption that using the exponentially-growing tree would result in modeling being effectively impossible for generational depths that are too high. While it is true that a generational depth of, say, 20 could result in $2^{20} \\approx 1.05 \\times 10^{6}$ neutrons that have to be simultaneously modeled, this assumes that *no neutrons are lost*, and this is completely unrealistic for the simulation. Even the most stable simulations I'm modelling will lose large amounts of neutrons, so these systems certainly aren't going to be reaching such large numbers of objects being handled at the same time. In particular, the effective multiplication rate for stable systems has experimentally trended towards being just above $k=1$ (reactor criticality), so the number of objects being managed is generally growing, but not by a considerable amount each generation."

    "\n",
    "Consider the core of a nuclear reactor. neutrons are, obviously, much smaller than the gaps between atoms and their neutral charge causes them to not have attractive force to free electrons or any repellant force, meaning that they can fairly easily escape the metallic bounds of reactor cores once atoms are split through fission. Therefore, it's fairly accurate to model the neutrons in a reactor as having no physical bounds whatsoever (in the form of a potential field blocking them from leaving), and this simulation seeks to investigate how often neutrons continue to replicate within this reactor.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a nuclear reaction progresses, neutrons \"replicate\" into several more by triggering further fission reactions in other atoms, and the amount of free neutrons that are \"produced\" from the triggered fission by the previous neutron are considered to be successfully replicated. However, as the neutrons leak out of the reactor, they're unlikely to return within the core to continue replications, and it's also unlikely for them to replicate outside of the core, so for the purposes of this reactor, we're only interested in the neutrons that replicate within the core, and any neutrons that leak out of the reactor can be said to be effectively lost to the reactor altogether. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can model this system using a non-physical bound for the reactor core and a growing tree of randomly-generated neutrons for the replications:\n",
    "- The reactor core is like a \"line in the sand\" rather than a wall: it has no power to stop neutrons from exiting, and they will do so randomly, but once they cross the boundary, further progress is entirely not considered. \n",
    "- The neutrons are assumed to always induce a chain reaction that produces exactly two further free neutrons every time, but each neutron that is produced is then sent off in a randomly-determined direction and distance from the reaction that produced it, and if it ends up outside of the reactor core, then that neutron is considered \"lost.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This, of course, requires an important distinction: each neutron is implicitly defined to replicate two further neutrons each time, but the effective replication rate is only considering the neutrons that remain in the reactor, so for example, a neutron could induce a reaction to produce two free neutrons, but if one neutron exits the reactor and the other ends within the reactor, then that neutron is said to have only replicated a single neutron, and the single neutron that remained in the reactor will induce another reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Question**\n",
    "\n",
    "With all of the above information in mind, for a given core shape, the reactor core is going to eventually reach a specific replication rate. Unstable reactor geometries would have replication rates approach zero due to too much leakage, and stable reactor geometries will have replication rates that stay roughly constant at some non-zero value. The focus of this simulation, in particular, is to see how this long-run replication rate changes as the geometry of the core changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, I've defined the reactor core's geometry as a rectangular prism, so for simplicity, we can call it a \"box.\" This means that the box's geometry has three parameters: a length $\\ell$, width $w$, and height $h$. To keep this simulation simple, we'll make the length $\\ell$ a function of the width and the height:\n",
    "$$\\ell = \\frac{1}{2} (w + h),$$\n",
    "Then, we can just vary the volume $V$ and the aspect ratio $R$ with each being explicit functions of only width and height:\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "R &= \\frac{w}{h} \\\\\n",
    "V &= w \\ell h = wh\\frac{1}{2}(w + h)\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "then each of the parameters are only a function of $R$ and $V$:\n",
    "$$\\begin{cases}\n",
    "w &= R \\left(\\frac{2V}{R(R+1)}\\right)^\\frac{1}{3} \\\\\n",
    "h &= \\left(\\frac{2V}{R(R+1)}\\right)^\\frac{1}{3} \\\\\n",
    "\\ell &= \\frac{1}{2} (R + 1) \\left(\\frac{2V}{R(R+1)}\\right)^\\frac{1}{3}\n",
    "\\end{cases}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have a two-dimensional phase space for the simulation, aspect ratio $R$ and volume $V$, and thus, each box geometry can be defined as a phase coordinate $(R,V)$. For each geometry, we can perform a singular simulation with a random starting position, then record the replication rate $k_i$ (for an individual simulation $i$) after a certain number of generations, $g$. (It's incredibly important that we pick $g$ correctly to best characterize our system, but for now, we'll just vaguely state that it's a large enough number to characterize the long-term behavior of the system.) We can then perform this individual simulation a large number of times with more random starting positions, making the overall simulation $f$ a Monte-Carlo simulation that estimates the long-term multiplication rate as $\\mathbf{k}$ based on the mean and standard error, $\\overline{k} + \\delta k$. Therefore, thus far, we're producing a mapping using our simulation $f$:\n",
    "$$f(R,V) \\mapsto \\mathbf{k} = \\overline{k} + \\delta k.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, simply put, the overarching goal is to calculate this mapping for each $(R,V)$ over some two-dimensional phase domain $D$\n",
    "$$D = \\{ R_{\\min} \\le R \\le R_{\\max} \\} \\otimes \\{ V_{\\min} \\le V \\le V_{\\max} \\}$$\n",
    "and then analyze the results we observe.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the hypothesis, one can safely assume from basic intuition that smaller volumes should be less likely to retain neutrons, as at an infinite volume of the reactor core (and also assuming the entirety of all space is filled with fuel in the realistic case), the reaction will proceed forever and grow over all space. However, the aspect ratio is much more interesting. We can reasonably assume that there should be the greatest preference to more even aspect ratios (closer to 1:1), because if the width, height, or length of the box is approximately zero, any movement of a neutron along the approximately zero axis in three-dimensional space will result in ejection.\""

So, in short, because the range of possible $k$ values for a given neutron is so limited, the negative contribution from low $k$ values will be much higher.\" and in figure 3, with the line \"The first generation will usually have a replication rate of $k=2$ or $k=1$\".

    "the uncertainty spikes just before all systems completely destabilize and both the multiplication rate and the uncertainty go to zero. This is interesting behavior for sure, and it's insightful for understanding the oddly random trends seen in the final contour, but it's not something that's particularly consistent enough or really representative to make a greater overall claim about how the uncertainty in all of the $k$ measurements is a function of the geometry of the box. I'll make sure to discuss the role that uncertainty is playing here in interpreting random behavior from the simulation, but fundamentally, the goal with the uncertainty through my investigation is simply as a guidepost for understanding what parameters need to be given to minimize this uncertainty enough that our results are accurate."

In any case, it's probably more accurate to examine these points in a much broader sense, considering the point $(R,V)=(1,200)$ as reflective of the broader class of even aspect ratios and large volumes and the point $(R,V)=(10,1)$ as reflective of the broader class of skewed aspect ratios and small volumes, and I can safely make much more general statements about how this relates to the overall trend of reactor stabilities without decreasing the quality of my conclusions/reflections."
