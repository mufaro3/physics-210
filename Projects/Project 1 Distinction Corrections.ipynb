From there, the best way to determine whether or not they've escaped is how far they are, and the best way to determine whether or not they will escape (if they haven't already) is how fast they are going. I don't make a consideration of whether the final velocity is oriented correctly (i.e., away from the black hole) as this can be reasonably assumed based on the parameters of the system (i.e., the ship is extremely unlikely to end up oriented in the direction of the black hole due to the restrictions of possible turning angles being explored in the simulation and the magnitude of initival velocities being performed being high enough that the gravitational acceleration from the black hole cannot reverse the motion of the ship during the simulation, so while it is possible that the ship could reverse, it is unlikely to occur during the time range of the simulation). \n",

    "This order is picked solely based on intuition. We consider the radial distance to be the most important because the immediate goal of these astronauts is to avoid the black hole at all costs (and nearly all of their efforts through the simulation is to avoid being sucked into the black hole). This is also why the final speed comes in second in importance, as faster exit speeds are more likely to escape the event horizon of the black hole. Then, the remaining fuel on board is considered last as it's important that they maintain some fuel for whatever endeavors they may need fuel for later, but it's not absolutely critical to their survival now.\n",

Next, we want there to be a hierarchical order, but we don't want any particular weight to be too dominant, i.e., the differences in the weights shouldn't be relatively large compared to the weights themselves. The last criteria is that these weights should sum to $1$ (for the sake of clearly expressing that they are weighting values for producing a utility. It doesn't effect the results for the weights to sum to one, but it helps with being clear about their relationship.) With these together, we can more or less pick any set of weights that seems reasonable and satisfies these two qualities, so I went with $w_1=2/10, w_2=5/10,$ and $w_3=3/10$.\""

Because the slime planet is so small now, without an extremely stiff density (completely unrealistically stiff, less of slime and more like eraser rubber, somewhat), the space ship can just completely pass through the slime planet without much problem. Again, this is because the ratio between the size of the slime planet and the space ship changed drastically as the radius of the slime planet was decreased because the space ship is approximated as a point-mass without a radius, so the ratio between the size of the two objects is essentially just the size of the slime planet itself.\n",

This means that it would penetrate the same distance into the slime planet as before without increasing the density, so without making the density quite high, it could completely pass through the planet without much impulse (which would make for a very boring simulation, as the ship would almost never be destroyed).\""

As stated before, the simulation has produced a mapping of each phase coordinate $(\\theta,v_0)$ to a scalar utility (or \"success\" or \"optimization\") score $U$, with higher utility scores being more favorable simulations based on the model weights, and for this model, the weights are $w_{fuel}=\\frac{2}{10},w_{distance}=\\frac{5}{10},$ and $w_{speed}=\\frac{3}{10}$.\"\n",

Taking a closer look into what occurs at this coordinate will yield some valuable insight into this simulation, because, for example, if this is a very trivial or otherwise poor result (like in the case that we cannot explain its behavior), then our optimization assumptions need to be reworked as the model is not optimizing for a true best-case scenario.\"\n",
