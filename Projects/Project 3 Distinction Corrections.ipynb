Neutrons that are closer to the edge are more likely to leave the box and neutrons that are closer to the centre are less likely to leave the box, so essentially, the initially random distribution of neutrons is more likely to have a greater distribution of neutrons toward the edges and away from the centre as in the long-run, the neutrons within the centre will be replicated and the neutrons toward the edges will be lost.\n",

This is because the starting random distribution is evenly distributed throughout the box, but neutrons closer to the centre are more likely to be replicated whereas neutrons closer to the edges are more likely to be lost, so a long-run stable distribution of neutrons would have more neutrons towards the centre and less neutrons towards the edges. This means that the initial random distribution must have a higher proportion of neutrons distributed towards the edges and a lower proportion of neutrons towards the centre, and this means that it must have a lower replication rates than toward the stable case.

    "so the convergence to a stable multiplication rate happened much sooner than in the case of using the lower number of initial neutrons and replications. The issue with this is that this means that the rate of convergence to stability is positively correlated with the number of initial neutrons and the number of replications (which we know by comparing it with our previous tests), so that means that if I were to determine the minimum stable generation depth from this graph (as it converges around generation 3 for such a precise test), the tests performed within the phase space exploration contour shouldn't be converged unless the full phase is calculated using the same paramteres of 400 replications and 1000 initial neutrons. In simpler words, the number of initial neutrons and replications have to be the same in this test case and in the phase exploration because the rate of convergence needs to be the same for the results to be accurate.\n",

    "> Your current implementation of multiplication rates treats each of the (usually) 250 initial neutrons as independent single-neutron trees and calculates k individually for each tree (resulting in initial neutrons * replications individual k values pooled together), rather than treating all 250 neutrons as one population per replication and calculating a single k value from the total population count. This causes much larger statistical fluctuations because individual tree k values are ratios of small integers (0/1, 3/2, 2/1, etc.) rather than ratios of large population counts (hundreds of neutrons), making the measurements highly sensitive to single-particle stochastic events, so extreme outliers often dominate your statistics. This issue is something that Homework 17 was designed to guard against, but you submitted something for that assignment that did not check the results of your simulation against results from correctly implemented physics and population-level statistics. Fixing this issue in your code and revising your write-up to account for differences in findings is a sizeable task, but is necessary for Level 2 distinction in this case.\n",

Uniform sampling of $\\varphi$ overweights the poles because the solid angle element $d \\Omega = \\sin \\varphi d \\varphi d \\theta$ shrinks near $\\varphi = 0, \\pi$. You need to sample $\\cos \\varphi$ uniformly from $[-1, 1]$ instead to compensate for this geometric factor like was shown in homework 17. Fixing this is quite straight forward, but may result in a occasional sufficiently large changes in your results that you will also need to rewrite some passages, captions, etc."

This begs the question of if the geometries along this line converge to a specific long-run multiplication rate whatsoever (which, if false, would counteract the main assumption of this previous investigation), but seeing as the considerations of this experiment are largely only focused on the trends observed along trivial cross-sections for even aspect ratios or large volumes rather than this section, further investigation into this region can be left for future exploration.\"\n",
