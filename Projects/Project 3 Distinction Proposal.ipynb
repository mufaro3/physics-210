    "I'm hoping to reach distinction level 1 with this project, particularly for my coding practices. I undoubtedly don't have the time to adapt this project in its entirety to a level 2-distinction, but I feel as though my potentially unconventional programming structure of utilizing trees and developing methods for easily traversing and managing the Neutron tree structures (like `traverse_tree`) make this project much more readable and effective (given appropriate justification of the time/space complexity due to the trees growing exponentially)."
