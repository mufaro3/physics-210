    "## Task 2: Euler's method for motion\n",
    "Euler's method is a simple numerical technique for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing motion or change over time. Over the next few weeks we will use increasingly sophisticated numerical techniques to solve increasingly complex physical systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will tackle 1D motion for situations where your first-year mechanics knowledge is more than sufficient to allow you to double-check the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with our fundamental definitions of velocity and acceleration, in differential form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d\\vec{r}}{dt} = \\vec{v} \\;\\;\\;\\;\\mbox{and}\\;\\;\\;\\; \\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} = \\vec{a}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For an object with constant acceleration and known initial conditions, we can know position and velocity for all times, but things can get much more complicated if the acceleration is not constant with time. A great example of this would be an object orbitting a much larger object in a non-circular path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the definition of a derivative for a small $\\Delta t$, we could write the above as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{r}(t+\\Delta t) \\approx \\vec{r}(t) + \\Delta t \\cdot \\vec{v}(t),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{v}(t+\\Delta t) \\approx \\vec{v}(t) + \\Delta t \\cdot \\vec{a}(t).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\approx$ reminds us that ratio of the left side to the right side approaches 1 as $\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0$. The formulas looks suspiciously similar to our first-year constant-acceleration kinematics equations, but we can use these ones even if the acceleration is not constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using numerical methods, if we know position and velocity at a specific time, we can find them a slightly later time $(t+\\Delta t)$ and can use those equations over and over again to find positions and velocities at any time in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solutions will always be approximations, which become more accurate the smaller we make $\\Delta t$. As we move toward Project 2, we will also encounter more sophisticated algorithms for solving ordinary differential equations."
